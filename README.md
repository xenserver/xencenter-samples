# XenCenter Plug-in Examples

XenCenter has plug-in capabilities which allow you to add custom menu items or
even whole tabs to the XenCenter window. You might do this as an ISV to integrate
your own product with XenCenter, or as an end-user to integrate with your
company's existing inventory management, for example.

This repository contains examples of how to create a XenCenter plug-in written
in various languages and build an installer for it.

## Documentation

[Citrix XenCenter Plug-in Specification Guide](https://developer-docs.citrix.com/projects/xencenter-plugin-specification/en/latest/)
contains the complete specification for developing XenCenter plug-ins.

A walk-through of the examples and instructions on how to compile the plug-in
installers are available in the [docs](docs/README.md) pages.
