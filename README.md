# XenCenter Plug-in Specification and Examples

XenCenter has plug-in capabilities which allow you to add custom menu items or
even whole tabs to the XenCenter window. You might do this as an ISV to integrate
your own product with XenCenter, or as an end-user to integrate with your
company's existing inventory management, for example.

This repository contains the complete specification for developing XenCenter
plug-ins, plus examples of how to create a plug-in written in various languages
and build an installer for it.

## Documentation

The complete specification for developing XenCenter plug-ins, a walk-through of
the examples, and instructions on how to compile the plug-in installers are
available in the [docs](docs/README.md) pages.
